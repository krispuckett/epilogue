# Compilation Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **ContentView.swift** - Fixed unused variable warnings by replacing with boolean test
2. **Typography.swift** - Fixed @MainActor issue with async Task wrapper
3. **UniversalCommandBar.swift** - Fixed deprecated onChange and variable mutability warnings

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### Deprecated Warnings (Low Priority)
Most deprecated warnings are in the `_Deprecated` folder which contains unused experimental views. These can be ignored.

### Active Files with Deprecations:
1. **LibraryView.swift** - Uses deprecated NavigationLink(destination:isActive:)
   - Should migrate to NavigationStack with navigationDestination
2. **AmbientBookView.swift** - Uses deprecated onChange 
   - Need to update to new iOS 17 syntax
3. **UIScreen.main** deprecations in several files
   - Should use trait collection or window scene

### Other Warnings:
- Various unused variable warnings (can use _ to suppress)
- Unused value warnings in deprecated files

## Next Steps

The app should now compile and run. The OKLABColorExtractor is properly integrated and will show color extraction when viewing book details.

To see the color extraction working:
1. Run the app
2. Navigate to any book detail view
3. Look for the colored circles showing the extracted palette
4. Check console for detailed extraction logs

The remaining warnings are non-critical and mostly in deprecated/unused files.
