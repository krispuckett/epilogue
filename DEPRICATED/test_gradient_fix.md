# Gradient Blue Color Fix Summary

## Issue
Blue colors were appearing in gradients for books with black and gold covers (like "Project Hail Mary").

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Blend Mode Artifacts**: The `.plusLighter` blend mode can create blue tints when blending dark colors with heavy blur
2. **Compression Artifacts**: JPEG compression can introduce subtle blue pixels in dark areas
3. **White Light Tinting**: Pure white lighting overlays can create blue tints when combined with certain blend modes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Adaptive Blend Mode (CinematicBookGradient.swift:133)
```swift
.blendMode(isDarkCover ? .screen : .plusLighter)
```
- Uses `.screen` blend mode for dark covers to avoid blue artifacts
- Keeps `.plusLighter` for light covers where it works well

### 2. Adaptive Blur Radius (CinematicBookGradient.swift:56)
```swift
.blur(radius: isDarkCover ? 60 : 80)
```
- Reduces blur for dark covers to preserve color accuracy
- Maintains higher blur for light covers

### 3. Blue Artifact Detection (CinematicBookGradient.swift:516-518)
```swift
let isBlueArtifact = (h > 0.55 && h < 0.7) && s < 0.3 && brightness < 0.3

if (s > 0.15 || brightness < 0.1) && !(r > 0.95 && g > 0.95 && b > 0.95) && !isBlueArtifact {
```
- Filters out low-saturation blue colors that are likely compression artifacts
- Preserves intentional blue colors with higher saturation

### 4. Warm White Lighting (CinematicBookGradient.swift:145-146)
```swift
Color(red: 1.0, green: 0.98, blue: 0.95).opacity(isDarkCover ? 0.4 : 0.25)
```
- Uses slightly warm white instead of pure white
- Prevents blue tinting from lighting overlays

### 5. Enhanced Debug Logging (CinematicBookGradient.swift:570-593)
- Logs extracted colors with hex values and HSB components
- Identifies and counts blue colors in the palette
- Helps diagnose color extraction issues

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Open the Gradient Test view
2. Select "Project Hail Mary" or another black/gold book
3. Switch to the "Cinematic" gradient
4. Check console logs for color extraction details
5. Use the new "Debug" button to see detailed color analysis

## Expected Results

- Black and gold/yellow colors should be properly extracted
- No unexpected blue tints in the gradient
- Smooth, cinematic gradient that matches the book's color scheme
