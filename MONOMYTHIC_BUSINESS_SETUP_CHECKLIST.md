## Phase 1: Business Structure & Legal Formation
**Timeline: Week 1 | Est. Cost: $50-$175**

### Decision: Choose Your Business Structure

| Structure | Best For | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|-----------|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Sole Proprietor** | Starting out, testing market | • No setup cost<br>• Simplest option<br>• Complete control | • No liability protection<br>• Pay 15.3% self-employment tax on ALL income<br>• Hard to scale | Revenue < $40K/year |
| **LLC (Default)** | Most consultants starting out | • Liability protection<br>• Easy to set up<br>• Flexible taxation | • Still pay 15.3% SE tax on all profit<br>• Annual fees | Revenue $40K-$60K/year |
| **LLC + S-Corp Election** | Established consultants | • Tax savings on income > $60K<br>• Pay SE tax only on salary portion<br>• Liability protection | • More paperwork<br>• Payroll requirements<br>• Reasonable salary required | Revenue > $60K/year |

**Tax Impact Example:**
- $150K profit as LLC: Pay $19,837 in self-employment tax
- $150K as S-Corp ($80K salary + $70K distribution): Pay ~$10,600 in SE tax
- **Savings: ~$9,200/year**

## Critical Success Factors

### Do These Things From Day 1:
