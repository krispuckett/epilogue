# Epilogue App - Comprehensive Security & Technical Audit Report

**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Auditor:** Claude Code  
**App Version:** Pre-TestFlight  
**Status:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - NOT READY FOR TESTFLIGHT**

---

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals several critical security vulnerabilities and performance issues that must be addressed before TestFlight submission. The app has significant security risks, memory management problems, and incomplete implementations that could lead to data breaches, crashes, and App Store rejection.

---

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. **API Key Exposed in Plain Text** 
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/Users/kris/Epilogue/Epilogue/Config.xcconfig:6`  
**Issue:** Perplexity API key is hardcoded and committed to the repository  
```
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = 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
```

**Impact:** 
- API key is publicly exposed if repo is public
- Could lead to unauthorized API usage and billing
- Violates security best practices

**Fix Required:**
1. Remove Config.xcconfig from git tracking immediately
2. Rotate the exposed API key in Perplexity dashboard
3. Use KeychainManager exclusively for API key storage
4. Add Config.xcconfig to .gitignore

### 2. **Incomplete Keychain Migration**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `KeychainManager.swift:151-165`  
**Issue:** API key migration from bundle happens automatically but doesn't delete from Info.plist

**Fix Required:**
- Remove API key from Info.plist after successful migration
- Ensure keychain is the only source of truth

### 3. **URL Validation Bypass Possible**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `URLValidator.swift`  
**Issue:** URL validation can be bypassed with encoded characters

**Fix Required:**
- Decode URLs before validation
- Add stricter pattern matching
- Implement Content Security Policy headers

---

## ðŸŸ¡ PERFORMANCE & MEMORY ISSUES

### 1. **Memory Leaks in Image Caching**
**Location:** `SharedBookCoverManager.swift`  
**Issues:**
- Active tasks dictionary (`activeTasks`) may retain tasks indefinitely on error
- No cleanup on task cancellation
- Disk cache cleanup runs on detached task without proper error handling

**Fix Required:**
```swift
// Add cleanup in loadAndCacheImage
defer {
    activeTasks.removeValue(forKey: cacheKey)
}
```

### 2. **Main Thread Blocking**
**Locations:** Multiple views  
**Issues:**
- Synchronous SwiftData queries on main thread
- Heavy color extraction on main thread in some paths
- No pagination for large datasets

**Fix Required:**
- Move queries to background contexts
- Implement pagination for notes/books lists
- Use async color extraction consistently

### 3. **Excessive Re-renders**
**Location:** `ContentView.swift`  
**Issues:**
- Multiple @StateObject and @State causing unnecessary refreshes
- No use of @StateObject for view models in some views
- Missing .equatable() on complex views

---

## ðŸŸ  DATA & PERSISTENCE ISSUES

### 1. **SwiftData Migration Fragility**
**Location:** `EpilogueApp.swift:58-81`  
**Issues:**
- No versioning strategy for schema changes
- Fallback creates new container, potentially losing data
- No backup before migration

**Fix Required:**
```swift
// Add migration plan
let migrationPlan = SchemaMigrationPlan(
    migrateFromV1ToV2: { context in
        // Migration logic
    }
)
```

### 2. **Incomplete Error Recovery**
**Location:** `ErrorHandlingService.swift`  
**Issues:**
- Data corruption errors don't attempt recovery
- No automatic retry for network errors
- Error history not persisted across app launches

---

## ðŸ”µ TESTFLIGHT BLOCKERS

### 1. **Missing Privacy Manifests**
**Required for TestFlight Spring 2025**
- No PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file
- Missing tracking domains declaration
- No data collection disclosure

### 2. **Incomplete Entitlements**
**Location:** `Epilogue.entitlements`
- Missing push notification entitlements
- No App Groups for widgets (if planned)

### 3. **Build Configuration Issues**
- No separate Debug/Release configurations
- Missing code signing settings
- No TestFlight-specific feature flags

### 4. **Crash Prevention Gaps**
- Force unwrapping in multiple locations
- No graceful degradation for missing images
- Unhandled optional chains that could crash

---

## ðŸŸ¢ POSITIVE FINDINGS

### Well-Implemented Features:
1. **Error Handling Framework** - Comprehensive error types and recovery
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Good instrumentation with PerformanceMonitor
3. **Image Caching Strategy** - Multi-tier caching with memory/disk
4. **Security Utilities** - URLValidator and SecureClipboard implementations
5. **Haptic Feedback** - Consistent use throughout the app

---

## UI/UX CONCERNS

### 1. **Accessibility Issues**
- Missing VoiceOver labels on custom buttons
- No Dynamic Type support in some views
- Insufficient color contrast in dark mode
- No keyboard navigation support

### 2. **Animation Performance**
- Glass effects may cause frame drops on older devices
- No reduced motion support
- Heavy blur effects in ambient mode

### 3. **User Experience Gaps**
- No onboarding flow
- Settings scattered across multiple locations
- No data export functionality visible
- Unclear navigation patterns in ambient mode

## ACTION PLAN FOR TESTFLIGHT

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Remove API key from Config.xcconfig
- [ ] Rotate compromised API key
- [ ] Implement proper keychain-only storage
- [ ] Add .gitignore entries
- [ ] Security audit all network calls

### Phase 2: Crash Prevention (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Fix all force unwraps
- [ ] Add nil checks for critical paths
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation

- [ ] Implement list pagination
- [ ] Profile with Instruments

### Phase 4: TestFlight Requirements (Day 7-8)
- [ ] Create PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
- [ ] Configure build schemes properly
- [ ] Set up code signing
- [ ] Add TestFlight test notes
- [ ] Create App Store Connect record

### Phase 5: Polish (Day 9-10)

- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement proper empty states
- [ ] Final QA pass

## RECOMMENDED MONITORING

### Pre-Launch:
1. Set up crash reporting
2. Implement analytics for key flows
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Set up error logging service

### Post-Launch:
1. Monitor API usage/costs
2. Track crash-free rate
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Track user engagement metrics

---

## CONCLUSION

**Current State:** The app shows promise with good architecture and thoughtful features, but has critical security vulnerabilities and stability issues that prevent TestFlight submission.

**Recommendation:** DO NOT SUBMIT TO TESTFLIGHT until all critical and high-priority issues are resolved. The exposed API key alone would likely result in immediate rejection and potential security incidents.

**Estimated Time to TestFlight Ready:** 10-14 days with focused development

**Next Steps:**
1. Immediately secure the API key
2. Fix critical crashes and memory leaks
3. Complete TestFlight requirements
4. Conduct thorough testing on physical devices
5. Consider a limited beta before wide TestFlight release

## FILES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

1. `/Users/kris/Epilogue/Epilogue/Config.xcconfig` - Remove API key
2. `/Users/kris/Epilogue/Epilogue/Epilogue/Info.plist` - Remove API key reference
3. `/Users/kris/Epilogue/Epilogue/Epilogue/EpilogueApp.swift` - Fix migration
4. `/Users/kris/Epilogue/Epilogue/Epilogue/Core/Images/SharedBookCoverManager.swift` - Fix memory leaks
5. All files with force unwrapping (`!`) - Add safety checks
