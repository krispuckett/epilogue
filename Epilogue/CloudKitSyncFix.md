# CloudKit Sync Fix Summary

## The Problem
Users were losing their data when reinstalling the app because CloudKit sync wasn't working properly. The app would fall back to local-only storage when CloudKit initialization failed, meaning data wasn't syncing to iCloud.

## Root Cause
In `EpilogueApp.swift`, the `setupModelContainer()` function had a fallback mechanism that would use local storage if CloudKit initialization failed. This meant:
1. If the app launched without network connectivity, it would use local storage
2. Once using local storage, it wouldn't switch to CloudKit
3. On reinstall, users' data wasn't in CloudKit, so it appeared lost

## The Fix
1. **Always prioritize CloudKit**: The app now retries CloudKit initialization multiple times
2. **Better error handling**: If CloudKit fails, the app uses temporary in-memory storage and shows an alert
3. **User feedback**: Added CloudKit status view in Settings to show sync status
4. **No silent fallback**: Removed the local-only storage fallback that was causing data loss

## Key Changes

### EpilogueApp.swift
- Added retry logic for CloudKit initialization (3 attempts with 1-second delays)
- Uses a named configuration "EpilogueCloudKit" to avoid conflicts
- Shows user alert if iCloud isn't available
- No longer falls back to local-only storage

### CloudKitStatusView.swift (New)
- Shows real-time iCloud sync status in Settings
- Provides troubleshooting steps if sync isn't working
- Direct link to iOS Settings for iCloud configuration

### CloudKitMigrationHelper.swift (New)
- Helper for future migrations from local to CloudKit storage
- Backup functionality before migrations
- Comprehensive data migration support

## Testing the Fix
1. Sign out of iCloud on device
2. Launch app - should see alert about iCloud requirement
3. Sign in to iCloud
4. Restart app - data should sync
5. Delete and reinstall app - data should restore

## Important Notes
- The app now REQUIRES iCloud for data persistence
- Without iCloud, data is only stored temporarily in memory
- This ensures users never lose data on reinstall
- CloudKit entitlements are properly configured: `iCloud.com.krispuckett.Epilogue`
