# Google Books Search Improvements

## Summary of Changes

Fixed the Google Books search to return better results by switching from the basic `GoogleBooksService` to the `EnhancedGoogleBooksService` and improving its ranking algorithm.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Service Implementation
- Changed `BookSearchSheet.swift` to use `EnhancedGoogleBooksService` instead of basic service
- Updated to use `searchBooksWithRanking()` method for better result quality

### 2. Improved Ranking Algorithm
- **Increased penalties** for study guides and summaries:
  - General unwanted terms penalty: -30 â†’ -50 points
  - SparkNotes/CliffNotes specific penalty: -200 points
  - Study guide authors penalty: -300 points
  
- **Added special handling for "The Hobbit"**:
  - +200 points for authentic Tolkien editions
  - -150 points for non-Tolkien versions
  - +50 points for reputable publishers (Houghton, Harper, Ballantine, Mariner)

### 3. Smarter Query Generation
- Special query optimization for "The Hobbit" searches
- Automatically adds author "J.R.R. Tolkien" when searching for The Hobbit
- Prioritizes exact title+author matches

### 4. Additional Unwanted Terms
Added more terms to filter out poor quality results:
- "quickread", "condensed", "abridged", "adapted", "retold", "simplified"

## Expected Results

When searching for "The Hobbit", users should now see:
1. Authentic J.R.R. Tolkien editions at the top
2. Editions from major publishers prioritized
3. SparkNotes and study guides heavily deprioritized or excluded
4. Better cover image quality from popular editions

## Testing Recommendations

Test searches for:
- "The Hobbit" 
- "hobbit"
- "The Hobbit by Tolkien"
- Other popular books to ensure general search quality remains good

The ranking system now heavily favors:
- Books with covers
- Books with ISBNs
- High ratings and review counts
- Exact title matches
- Proper author attribution
- Major publishers
