# Dynamic Gradient Opacity Implementation

## Overview
Implemented dynamic gradient opacity in BookDetailView that fades the background gradient as the user scrolls down, creating a more refined reading experience.

## Technical Details

### 1. Added Gradient Opacity Calculation
```swift
// Dynamic gradient opacity based on scroll
private var gradientOpacity: Double {
    // Gradient fades from 100% to 20% over 200pt of scroll
    let fadeDistance: CGFloat = 200
    let opacity = 1.0 - (Double(max(0, -scrollOffset)) / Double(fadeDistance))
    return max(0.2, min(1.0, opacity))
}
```

### 2. Applied Opacity to Gradient
- Added `.opacity(gradientOpacity)` to BookAtmosphericGradientView
- Added smooth animation with `.animation(.easeOut(duration: 0.2), value: gradientOpacity)`

### 3. Behavior
- Gradient starts at 100% opacity when scrolled to top
- Fades to 20% opacity after scrolling 200 points down
- Smooth animation prevents jarring transitions
- Minimum opacity of 20% ensures background remains visible

## Benefits
1. **Better Content Focus**: As users scroll to read, the gradient fades to reduce visual distraction
2. **Improved Readability**: Less background interference when viewing text content
3. **Smooth Experience**: Animated transitions feel natural and polished
4. **Maintains Atmosphere**: 20% minimum opacity keeps the book's color theme present

## Implementation Notes
- Uses existing ScrollOffsetPreferenceKey infrastructure
- No performance impact due to efficient opacity changes
- Works seamlessly with existing color extraction system
